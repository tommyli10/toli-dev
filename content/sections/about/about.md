My name is Tommy Li, and I bring a unique set of technical expertise, creative flair, and problem-solving skills to the world of software development. With a background in architecture and building web applications and open-source products for clients, I build with both aesthetic and user experience in mind to ensure the final product has a perfect blend of form and function.

When I'm not coding up a storm or learning new technologies and adding them to my tool bag, I can be found scaling a bouldering wall at my local rock climbing gym or trying to stay alive in Elden Ring. Other than playing video games and solving challenging problems, my time spent studying in Rome has made cooking Italian dishes a passion of mine (please let me know if you have a gnocchi recipe that's easy to make).
