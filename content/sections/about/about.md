When I'm not coding up a storm or learning new technologies and adding them to my tool bag, I can be found scaling a bouldering wall at my local rock climbing gym or dying in Elden Ring. Other than playing video games and solving challenging problems, my time spent studying in Rome has made cooking Italian dishes a passion of mine.
